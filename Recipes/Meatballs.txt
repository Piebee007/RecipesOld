Meatballs
Serves: 4
Time: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
24 Meatballs
1 Jar of bolognese sauce
1-2 Onions, chopped
2-3 Garlic cloves, minced
200g Broccoli
150g of frozen peas
1 teaspoon Mixed herbs
1 Beef stock cube, crumbled
350g Pasta (such as spaghetti, penne or fusilli)
Optional: 1 grated carrot
Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)
Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180°C. Arrange the meatballs on a baking tray and cook for 25 minutes, turning halfway.
In a large saucepan, heat the Bolognese sauce over low heat. Add half a jar of water to the sauce and stir to combine. Simmer gently.
In a separate frying pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they are soft and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and optional grated carrot and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the onions and garlic to the tomato sauce. Stir in the crumbled beef stock cube, mixed herbs, salt, and black pepper. Keep the sauce warm on low heat.
With 15 minutes left on the meatballs, add the broccoli florets to a pot of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. In a seperate pot add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions. Add the frozen peas during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
Drain the vegetables and add to the tomato sauce and crush the broccoli into smaller pieces. Drain the pasta.
Once the meatballs are done, add them to the tomato sauce and stir to combine. Add the cooked pasta and mix well.
Serve the meatballs with pasta and vegetables hot, with grated Parmesan cheese on top if desired.
