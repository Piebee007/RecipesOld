Chicken Fried Rice
Serves: 4
Time: 
Ingredients:
400g Chicken Breast, cubed and optionally marinated in soysauce and garlic
400g Rice, cooked and cooled
4 Eggs, beaten
1 Carrot, cut into small chunks
1 Onion, Diced
1-2 Hand fulls of Frozen Peas
1-2 Spring Onions, sliced
2 Garlic Cloves, roughly chopped
1tsp Seasame Oil
Lots of soy sauce
Instructions:
In a large pan or wok, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the diced chicken and cook until it turns white and is no longer pink in the center. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set it aside.
In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed and saut√© the minced garlic, diced onion, and carrot chunks until they start to soften.Then add the peas and cook for a further 5 minutes.
Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the beaten eggs to the empty space. Scramble the eggs until they are cooked. Mix the scrambled egg with the vegetables.
Add the cooked rice to the pan. Drizzle the sesame oil over the rice and stir-fry it for a few minutes to heat it up and incorporate the flavors with the vegetables.
Return the cooked chicken to the pan and mix it with the rice and vegetables.
Add soy sauce to the pan, starting with a small amount, and gradually increase to taste. Be generous with the soy sauce, as it adds flavor to the fried rice.
Remove the pan from the heat and serve the chicken fried rice hot.
