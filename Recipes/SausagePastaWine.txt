Sausage Pasta Wine
Serves:4
Time: 45 minutes
Ingredients:
6 caramelised onion sausages
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 can (400g) of tomatoes
300g Pasta (fusilli or farfalle)
150g of frozen peas
Grated parmesan (optional)
1tsp vegetable bullion powder
1tsp gravy granules
Grated parmesan cheese to serve (optional)
Instructions:
Fry sausages slowly until just cooked. Remove and cut into bite size pieces.
Add chopped onion to sausage pan and cook slowly.
To another large pan, add the cut sausages and add a large class of wine/small bottle. Gently simmer.
Once the onion is cooked, add the tin of tomatoes and heat through adding the bullion and gravy granules.
Transfer this mixture to the sausages.
Rinse out the tomatoe tin with some water and add it to the frying the sauapan to deglaze it. Then add to the sausages.
Cook for about 20-30 minutes (longer the better). The sauce should have thickened but should still be fairly liquidy.
Cook the pasta as per instructions. With 5 minutes to go, add the frozen peas (make sure the pasta is boiling fiercely when you add the peas).
Drain the pasta and peas and then add them to the sausage mixture. 
Mix to make sure pasta is covered in the sauce. Keep on the heat for about 2 minutes.
Serve hot, garnished with grated parmesan cheese if desired.
