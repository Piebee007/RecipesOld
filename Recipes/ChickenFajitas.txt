Serves: 4
Time: 30
Ingredients:
500g boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
1 onion, thinly sliced

2tsp chili powder
1tsp ground cumin
1tsp Paprika
1/2 tsp dried oregano
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and pepper to unique_tags_text
8 tortillas
Optional toppings: lettuce, cucumber, tomato, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, grated Cheese
Instructions:
In a bowl, combine the chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, minced garlic, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.
Place the sliced chicken in a separate bowl and pour the marinade over it. Toss the chicken until it is evenly coated. Let it marinate for at least 10 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 1 hour for more flavor.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken to the skillet, and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.
If using a bell pepper, in the same skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the sliced onion and bell pepper to the skillet, and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender-crisp. If not using a bell pepper, proceed to the next step.
Return the cooked chicken to the skillet (without the bell pepper) with the onions and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to heat everything through.
Warm the flour tortillas either by wrapping them in foil and placing them in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for a few minutes or by heating them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side.
Serve the chicken and onion mixture in warm tortillas. Garnish with your preferred toppings such as sour cream, guacamole, salsa, shredded cheese, and chopped cilantro.
Roll up the tortillas and enjoy the delicious chicken fajitas!
Note: Feel free to customize your chicken fajitas by adding additional toppings or ingredients such as sliced avocado, diced tomatoes, or hot sauce. If you prefer, you can include a red bell pepper as an optional ingredient for added flavor and color.
